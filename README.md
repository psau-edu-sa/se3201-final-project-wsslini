## basic architecture in client-Server System

## Advantages of clinet-Server 
#### Security
Because of the centralized architecture of the client server network, data is adequately
safeguarded. Access restrictions can be used to ensure that only authorized users have
access. Imposing credentials such as a login and password is one such way. Furthermore, if
the data is lost, it is simple to retrieve the files from a single backup.
#### Adaptability
Customers can easily expand the number of clients or servers. Because the server is
centralized, there are no concerns regarding authorization to network resources growing in
size. As a result, the setups only require a small number of people.
#### Centralization
The primary advantage of a client-server network is that it enables centralized management. All
of the information is available in one location. This is particularly helpful since the network
administrator has total control over management and administration. Any problem that emerges
throughout the network may be handled in a single location. It is also easy to update data.



## Disadvantages of clinet-Server 
#### Traffic Congestion
The primary disadvantage of client server network is the traffic congestion it undergoes. If
too many clients make request from the same server, it will result in crashes or slowing
down of the connection. An overloaded server creates many problems in accessing
informations.
#### Cost
The cost involved in setting up and maintaining the server is usually high in client server
network as it does on the network operations. Since the networks are powerful they can be
expensive to purchase. Hence, not all the users will be able to afford them.
#### Maintenance
When the servers are implemented, it is going to work non-stop. Which means it must be given
proper attention. If there are any problems, it must be resolved immediately without any delay.
Hence, there should be a specialized network manager appointed to maintain the server.

## Examples of Client-Server System :
examples of a client server system on the internet are file transfer protocol clients (FTPs), Web servers, Web browsers and DNS. 
Email, network printing, and the World Wide Web.


##  Why we selected Client-Server and the criteria used
